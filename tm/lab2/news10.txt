In a statement, Heritage Lifecare Group who manages the facility says they are working with the Auckland DHB and Ministry of Health for further testing. 

The staff member had returned home from overseas on March 10 before working two night shifts at the facility with no symptoms at that time. 

They told their manager after a day off that they had a headache and were required to follow protocol by talking to a doctor. The person was then tested for Covid-19, which came back positive. 

All residents at the aged care facility have been placed in isolation as a precaution. 

“We have advised our residents and their families of the situation," Heritage Lifecare Group CEO Norah Barlow said in a statement.

"This is obviously a concerning time for the residents and our team and we are providing them with appropriate support." 

All staff who had a close working relationship with the person are now also being tested and will be taking additional precautions by wearing face masks on shifts.

with your supervisor working on the proposal before you are ready and are set up for conducting the
research. Explicit approval is required before you continue with the research.
# Draft Proposal

# Introduction
> describing the topic area, why you are interested in it, why it is relevant to others, what potential contribution it will make.

# literature critique
a summary of what research methods are used, what is known about the topic area, and the challenges and difficulties.

# overview of all the research required to investigate your topic area
Typically, you will choose a small part of this to do as your project. Perhaps, it is the first thing to do. Perhaps, it is the bit you can do. Give rationale for your decision.

# Research question
This may contain a number of sub-questions.

# Research Method
A plan of action: what, where, who, why and how.

# A pilot test run of the method
This is often extremely useful in informing you on how to refine details of your method and its application. A pilot test can also be very useful in assisting you to refine and scope your research question. If you donâ€™t consider a pilot test appropriate, consult with your supervisor.

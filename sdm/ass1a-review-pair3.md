>Introduction is complete and communicates a clear and accurate high-level understanding of the technology

In the first part, a brief overview is given. Then the concept of micro-service is introduced from a historical perspective, with emphasis on the difference between micro-service and SOA architecture. An example of Weibo is also analysed for demonstration of the ideas. Then the main characteristics of micro-service are recapped. However, it seems that the core value of micro-services is not described quite clearly.

- It seems that the core values of Microservices is yet mentioned in the report ?

>A significant application of the technology is explained clearly. A link to a sample application or simulation is provided.

The example of designing an online shopping website with micro-service architecture is fully demonstrated, and also compared with single system as case study. A sample application is provided as a architecture but not a live demo portal is provided.
The example of designing an online shopping website with micro-service architecture is fully demonstrated, and also compared with single system as case study.

- A sample application is provided as a archetecture but no a live demo portal is provided. 
 
>How to develop an application using this technology is explained with reference to libraries and frameworks and tools. A link to example code is provided.
 
Spring Cloud is carefully described as a practical micro-service framework. A case study is also provided to demonstrate how to develop a e-commerce business application with this framework. The diagram is informative but there is not much description and analysis.

> Some important challenges or shortcomings of the technology are clearly explained

The challenges or shortcomings is lack of statement and explanation.

>At least one credible academic research paper is referenced to describe research related to the application or development of software using this technology.

- It seems that the case study which is described on the report is not an academic journal paper. 
 
>The presented arguments and viewpoints evaluating the impact of the technology on software development in the future are plausible, well-reasoned and well supported.

The impact of this technology is mentioned at several place in this report, but not much. It would be better if add more analysis, argument or evidence.

>The conclusion is a useful summary

In the conclusion part, the key points and benefits of micro-service are recapped. 

It would be better if can find more reliable sources to prove this technology.

>Uses credible sources for information

- It would be better if can find more reliable sources to prove this technology.
 
>Represents a reasonable effort

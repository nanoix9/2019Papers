ask a question

unintelligence: didn't answer the cognitive paradox

# what is the paradox in infant learning?

- robot mapping: creating precise map vs incomplete map in human brain

# Part A

identify a few existing learning algorithm and prove they are not intelligent

how infant learning: infant learned the rules of the physical world in the first six months

# Part B

start from the input of infant: view

view -> what can be computed initially (not to learn)? ->

how can be computed from the view to guide the learning process?

Nowadays AI is under fast development and changing our world. Despite people are enjoying the benefits that AI brings, a few scientists and professionals are concerned about the potential threat from AI in the future[@wiki:Open_Letter_on_Artificial_Intelligence]. In fact, the question of "Will AI destroy humankind?" has been widely discussed and researched for a long time from serious academic scholars to fiction writers[@wiki:AI_takeover]. While some optimists may hold the belief that AI will benefit under absolute control of human, by contrast, I think it is possible for AI to damage or even extinguish human race if we are incautious. In this essay, I will analyze the conditions of AI takeover and what actions can be taken to prevent them.

If AI can destroy humankind, three conditions must be satisfied:

1. AI has the ability
2. AI has the chance
3. AI has the motivation

First and obviously, AI must have the ability to destroy human before it does so. AI agents based on state-of-art technology don't have such ability, but AI technologies might evolve rapidly and superhuman AI ultimately comes into reality in the future.

Second, AI must have the chance to destroy human, in other words, AI is lost of absolute control by its creators. If this could happen, AI must be able to reproduce themselves because if ..........

Finally, AI must have the motivation to destroy human. This is the most tricky one among the three conditions.

Going one step further, we may even claim that a software architecture is the set of design decisions

The shift in attention from a solution-oriented view to a decision-oriented view of software architecture has spawn new lines of research.

 A lot of knowledge of a software
development organization is kept in unstructured forms:
FAQs, mailing lists, email repositories, bug reports, lists of
open issues, and so on. Lightweight tools like wikis, weblogs, and yellow pages are other examples of relatively
unstructured repositories to share information in global
projects.

In the knowledge management literature, a distinction
is often made between the personalization strategy and the
codification strategy. The personalization strategy emphasizes interaction between knowledge workers. The knowledge itself is kept by its creator. One personalization strategy is to record who knows what, as in yellow pages. Each
person then has his own way to structure the knowledge.
The threshold to participate is usually low, but the effort to
find useful information is higher. In the codification strategy, the knowledge is codified and stored in a repository.
The repository may be unstructured, as in wikis, or structured according to some model. In the latter case, the structure of the repository can be used while querying.

So the software architecture can be used to reduce the
need or communication in a multi-site development project.
